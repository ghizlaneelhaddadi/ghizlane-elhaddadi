# Hi, I’m Ghizlane 

I’m a Master’s student in **Big Data, Artificial Intelligence & Advanced Applications** at *Université Ibn Tofail* in Kenitra.

I’m passionate about using data and AI to make a difference — whether it’s detecting phishing emails, analyzing EEG signals to understand emotions, or building smart web platforms. I enjoy learning, experimenting, and turning ideas into projects that actually work.

- **EEG Signal Analysis**  
  Analyzed brain signals to explore emotional patterns and cognitive states.

- **Physical Intrusion Detection Using Autonomous Drone Swarms**  
  Implemented a real-time surveillance system using autonomous drones. Designed a data pipeline integrating Kafka, Kafka Streams, and Apache Flink. Leveraged Java synchronization for efficient anomaly detection and parallel processing.

- **Job Recommendation Platform**  
  Built a web application combining **web scraping** and **machine learning** to suggest relevant jobs.
