# Hi, I’m Ghizlane  

I’m a Master’s student in **Big Data, Artificial Intelligence & Advanced Applications** at *Université Ibn Tofail* in Kenitra, Morocco.  

I’m really passionate about how data and AI can be used to make a difference — whether it’s detecting phishing emails, understanding emotions from EEG signals, or building smart web platforms.  
I enjoy learning, experimenting, and turning ideas into projects that actually work.

-  **EEG Signal Analysis**  
  Analyzing brain signals to explore emotional patterns and cognitive states.  

-  **Job Recommendation Platform**  
  A web project combining **web scraping** and **machine learning** to suggest relevant jobs.  

-  **Physical Intrusion Detection Using Autonomous Drone
Swarms**  
  Implemented a real-time surveillance system using autonomous drones. Designed a data pipeline integrating Kafka, Kafka Streams, and Apache Flink, leveraging Java synchronization for efficient anomaly detection and parallel processing.
