# Hi, I’m Ghizlane  

I’m a Master’s student in **Big Data, Artificial Intelligence & Advanced Applications** at *Université Ibn Tofail* in Kenitra, Morocco.  

I’m really passionate about how data and AI can be used to make a difference — whether it’s detecting phishing emails, understanding emotions from EEG signals, or building smart web platforms.  
I enjoy learning, experimenting, and turning ideas into projects that actually work.
